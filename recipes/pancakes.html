  <h2>Description</h2>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    
    <ul>
        <p><li>2 cups whole milk</li></p>
        <p><li>1/4 cup white vinegar</li></p>
        <p><li>2 1/2 cups flour</li></p>
        <P><li>3/4 cup sugar</li></P>
        <p><li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li></p>
        <p><li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li></p>
        <p><li>1 teaspoon salt</li></p>
        <p><li>3 large eggs</li></p>
        <p><li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li></p>
        <p><li>1 tablespoon butter, softened, or as needed, for greasing, plus more for serving</li></p>
        <p><li>toppings of choice, e.g. maple syrup or fruit, for serving</li></p>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <p><li>Preheat a griddle to 300 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li></p>
        <p><li>Stir together milk and vinegar in a small bowl or a 4-cup liquid measuring cup.</li></p>
        <p><li>Whisk together flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a second bowl.</li></p>
        <p><li>Beat eggs in a large bowl until smooth. Add vanilla and milk mixture; whisk together. Add flour mixture to bowl with egg mixture and whisk until just combined. (Batter will be lumpy.) Let rest 3 minutes and gently stir again.</li></p>
        <p><li>Melt some butter on the griddle, then carefully wipe with a paper towel. (You want just a bit of a sheen; don't overgrease the griddle.) Spoon batter in 1/3-cup portions onto griddle. Cook until bubbles form on surface of batter, about 2 1/2 minutes.</li></p>
        <p><li>Flip pancakes and cook until browned on the other side, about 1 1/2 minutes more. Repeat with remaining batter. Serve immediately with butter and toppings.</li></p>
    </ol>
